SigDirect code has only one parameter that is p-value, which doesnt need much tuning. However, config file can be used to change its value.
-Run SigDirect_test.py with the dataset name. (sigdirect_test.py iris)
-The threshold for confidence values can be changed in SigDirect file, in the ripper pruning function.  (if needed)
-The fit function creates the model and  predict or predict_proba give the prediction in the form of classes and probability distributions respectively.
